Understanding Istio and TCP services



By using a real use-case scenario, we explore how Istio routes TCP traffic and how to get past some common pitfalls we’ve encountered firsthand.

### overview

I lately came across an Istio setup where both the downstream (client) and the upstream (server) were using the same sets of ports:

*   port **8080** for HTTP protocol
*   port **5701** for [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) protocol, a Java based memory database embedded in the pod’s workload, using TCP

The setup is presented here:

![image](/content/posts/2020-08-06_understanding-istio-and-tcp-services/images/2.png#layoutTextWidth)


In theory, two types of communications happens:

*   each Hazelcast database (the red and purple cylinders) talk to each other on port **5701** using TCP protocol. Cluster is discovered using the [Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes) which calls the API to get the Pod IPs. Then connections are made at TCP level using the IP:port of the pod
*   the `manager` calls the `app` on the http port **8080**

We’re going to focus on the first connexion for now, specifically the one happening between the `manager` pods as they are going through the Istio Proxy.

Let’s first leverage the `istioctl` CLI to get the configuration of the listeners on one of the pods:
`istioctl pc listeners manager-c844dbb5f-ng5d5.manager --port 5701``ADDRESS         PORT     TYPE  
10.12.0.11      5701     TCP  
10.0.23.154     5701     TCP  
10.0.18.143     5701     TCP`

We have 3 entries for port **5701**. They are all of type`TCP` which is what we defined.

We clearly see we have one entry for our local IP (`10.12.0.11`) and one for each service which is using the **5701** port, the `manager` (`10.0.23.154`) and the `app` (`10.0.18.143`) services.

### Inbound connections

The first one, for address `10.12.0.11` is an `INBOUND`listener that is used when connections enters into the Pod. As we are on a TCP service, it does not have a route, but directly point to a cluster, `inbound|5701|tcp-hazelcast|manager.manager.svc.cluster.local`

If we check all clusters on port **5701** we have:
`istioctl pc clusters manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --port 5701``SERVICE FQDN                          PORT     SUBSET            DIRECTION     TYPE  
app.app.svc.cluster.local             5701     -                 outbound      EDS  
manager.manager.svc.cluster.local     5701     -                 outbound      EDS  
manager.manager.svc.cluster.local     5701     tcp-hazelcast     inbound       STATIC`

The last one is our `INBOUND` , let’s check it:
`istioctl pc clusters manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --port 5701 --direction inbound -o json``[  
    {  
        &#34;name&#34;: &#34;inbound|5701|tcp-hazelcast|manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
        &#34;type&#34;: &#34;STATIC&#34;,  
        &#34;connectTimeout&#34;: &#34;1s&#34;,  
        &#34;loadAssignment&#34;: {  
            &#34;clusterName&#34;: &#34;inbound|5701|tcp-hazelcast|manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
            &#34;endpoints&#34;: [  
                {  
                    &#34;lbEndpoints&#34;: [  
                        {  
                            &#34;endpoint&#34;: {  
                                &#34;address&#34;: {  
                                    &#34;socketAddress&#34;: {  
                                        &#34;address&#34;: &#34;127.0.0.1&#34;,  
                                        &#34;portValue&#34;: 5701  
                                    }  
                                }  
                            }  
                        }  
                    ]  
                }  
            ]  
        },  
        &#34;circuitBreakers&#34;: {  
            &#34;thresholds&#34;: [  
                {  
                    &#34;maxConnections&#34;: 4294967295,  
                    &#34;maxPendingRequests&#34;: 4294967295,  
                    &#34;maxRequests&#34;: 4294967295,  
                    &#34;maxRetries&#34;: 4294967295  
                }  
            ]  
        }  
    }  
]`

This can’t be simpler… check the `lbEndpoints` definition: just forward the connection to the `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`) port **5701**, our app.

### Outbound connections

Outbound connections are originating from inside the pod to reach external resources.

From what we saw above, we have two known endpoints that defined the port **5701**: `manager.manger` service and `app.app` service.

Let’s check the content of the `manager`:
`istioctl pc listeners manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --port 5701 --address 10.0.23.154 -o json``[  
    {  
        &#34;name&#34;: &#34;10.0.23.154_5701&#34;,  
        &#34;address&#34;: {  
            &#34;socketAddress&#34;: {  
                &#34;address&#34;: &#34;10.0.23.154&#34;,  
                &#34;portValue&#34;: 5701  
            }  
        },  
        &#34;filterChains&#34;: [  
            {  
                &#34;filters&#34;: [  
                    {  
                        &#34;name&#34;: &#34;envoy.tcp_proxy&#34;,  
                        &#34;typedConfig&#34;: {  
                            &#34;[@type](http://twitter.com/type)&#34;: &#34;type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.filter.network.tcp_proxy.v2.TcpProxy&#34;,  
                            &#34;statPrefix&#34;: &#34;outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
                            &#34;cluster&#34;: &#34;outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
                            &#34;accessLog&#34;: [  
...  
                            ]  
                        }  
                    }  
                ]  
            }  
        ],  
        &#34;deprecatedV1&#34;: {  
            &#34;bindToPort&#34;: false  
        },  
        &#34;trafficDirection&#34;: &#34;OUTBOUND&#34;  
    }  
]`

I removed some of the values here so we better understand. It’s not that complicated.

First, we match on the destination IP and port
`&#34;address&#34;: {  
            &#34;socketAddress&#34;: {  
                &#34;address&#34;: &#34;10.0.23.154&#34;,  
                &#34;portValue&#34;: 5701  
            }  
        },`

Then we have a `filterChain` and an `envoy.tcp.proxy` filter.   
Here again, the proxy points us to cluster named `outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local` .   
Envoy is not using any route as we are using a TCP protocol and we have nothing to base the routing on anyways.

Let’s see inside the cluster:
`istioctl pc clusters manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --port 5701 --fqdn manager.manager.svc.cluster.local --direction outbound -o json``[  
    {  
        &#34;transportSocketMatches&#34;: [  
            {  
                &#34;name&#34;: &#34;tlsMode-istio&#34;,  
                &#34;match&#34;: {  
                    &#34;tlsMode&#34;: &#34;istio&#34;  
                },  
...  
                }  
            },  
            {  
                &#34;name&#34;: &#34;tlsMode-disabled&#34;,  
                &#34;match&#34;: {},  
                &#34;transportSocket&#34;: {  
                    &#34;name&#34;: &#34;envoy.transport_sockets.raw_buffer&#34;  
                }  
            }  
        ],  
        &#34;name&#34;: &#34;outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
        &#34;type&#34;: &#34;EDS&#34;,  
        &#34;edsClusterConfig&#34;: {  
            &#34;edsConfig&#34;: {  
                &#34;ads&#34;: {}  
            },  
            &#34;serviceName&#34;: &#34;outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;  
        },  
        &#34;connectTimeout&#34;: &#34;1s&#34;,  
        &#34;circuitBreakers&#34;: {  
...  
        },  
        &#34;filters&#34;: [  
...  
        ]  
    }  
]`

I also removed some parts here to focus on the important stuff:

*   first two blocks: Envoy will check if it can do SSL (TLS) and set the certificate if we can. Else, use plain TCP.
*   find the destination’s pod using the `EDS` protocol. This stands for `E`ndpoint `D`iscovery `S`ervice. 
Envoy will look up its list of endpoints for the service named `outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local
`These endpoints are selected based on the Kubernetes service endpoint list (`kubectl get endpoints -n manager manager`).

We can also check the list of endpoints configured in Istio:
`istioctl pc endpoints manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --cluster &#34;outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;``ENDPOINT            STATUS      OUTLIER CHECK     CLUSTER  
10.12.0.12:5701     HEALTHY     OK                outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local  
10.12.1.6:5701      HEALTHY     OK                outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local`

All this sounds pretty good.

### Testing the setup

To demonstrate the whole thing, let’s connect to one of the manager’s pod and call the service on port **5701**:
`k -n manager exec -ti manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx -c manager sh``telnet manager.manager 5701`

You should get the following answer after pushing the enter key some times:
`Connected to manager.manager``Connection closed by foreign host`

The server we are using is in fact an HTTPS web server, expecting a TLS handshake… but whatever, we just want to connect to a TCP port here. So, the connection is working fine.

Repeat this command multiple times.

Let’s look at the logs from the Istio-Proxy sidecars, using the K8s log tailer [Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern):
`stern -n manager manager -c istio-proxy``manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx istio-proxy [2020-07-23T14:26:27.081Z] &#34;- - -&#34; 0 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; 6 0 506 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;10.12.0.12:5701&#34; outbound|5701||manager.manager.svc.cluster.local 10.12.0.12:51100 10.0.23.154:5701 10.12.0.12:47316 - -

I grouped the requests by two, and I have two different pairs:

1.  an `outbound` connection to `manager.manager.svc`
2.  an inbound connection to ourselves
3.  an `outbound` connection to `manager.manager.svc`
4.  an inbound connection on the second manager’s Pod (`10.12.2.8:5701`)

Of course, Istio is using the round-robin load-balancing algo by default, so it totally explain what is going on here. Each consecutive request go to a different pod.

Here, blue link is `outbound` while pink is `inbound`

![image](/content/posts/2020-08-06_understanding-istio-and-tcp-services/images/3.png#layoutTextWidth)


OK, this is not really what’s going on ! I tricked you !!

Istio (Envoy) does NOT send traffic to the Kubernetes Service. Services are used by Pilot (Istiod) to build the mesh topology, then the informations is sent to each Istio-proxy, which then send traffic to the Pods. It finally look more like that:

![image](/content/posts/2020-08-06_understanding-istio-and-tcp-services/images/4.png#layoutTextWidth)


But that’s not how Hazelcast server works either !

### Hazelcast cluster communication

The truth is, Hazelcast does no use the service name for its communications.

In fact, the [Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes) leverage the Kubernetes API (or a Headless service) to learn about all the pods play in the Hazelcast cluster. It’s unclear to me if it’s then using the Pod’s FQDN or it’s IP. In fact it does not matter to us.

As with every application using a “smart” client, like Kafka, each instance needs to talk directly to each of the other instances that are part of the cluster.

So, what’s happening if we try to call the second manager’s Pod using it’s IP ?

Client pod:
`manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx istio-proxy [2020-07-23T14:39:12.587Z] &#34;- - -&#34; 0 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; 6 0 2108 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;10.12.2.8:5701&#34; PassthroughCluster 10.12.0.11:51428 10.12.2.8:5701 10.12.0.11:51426 - -`

Server pod:
`manager-7948dffbdd-sh7rx istio-proxy [2020-07-23T14:39:13.590Z] &#34;- - -&#34; 0 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; 6 0 1113 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;127.0.0.1:5701&#34; inbound|5701|tcp-hazelcast|manager.manager.svc.cluster.local 127.0.0.1:59986 10.12.2.8:5701 10.12.0.11:51428 - -`

1.  the outbound connection is using the Passthrough cluster as the destination IP (`10.12.2.8`) is not known inside the mesh
2.  the upstream connection uses the `inbound` cluster as before

Here’s a schema of this situation. In red, the Hazelcast DB nodes (the red cylinder) calls the API (the red-dot arrow) to get all the pods that are part of the cluster. Once done, the first pod calls the IP of the next pod (blue line).

![image](/content/posts/2020-08-06_understanding-istio-and-tcp-services/images/5.png#layoutTextWidth)


This is not perfect, but at least, it’s working

### Things can go bad

Later on I was called as something strange was going on in the cluster.

At some point, when the manager application tried to connect to the Hazelcast port, the connection was routed to the `idle` pod in the manager namespace.  
How possible ? This pod even don’t expose the port **5701** !

Here’s an overview:

![image](/content/posts/2020-08-06_understanding-istio-and-tcp-services/images/6.png#layoutTextWidth)


Nothing changed in the `manager` Namespace, but looking at the services inside the `app` namespace, I saw an `ExternalName` service was later added:
`k get svc  -n app``NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP                      PORT(S)             AGE  
app       ClusterIP      10.0.18.143   &lt;none&gt;                           8080/TCP,5701/TCP   18h  
app-ext   ExternalName   &lt;none&gt;        idle.manager.svc.cluster.local   8080/TCP,5701/TCP   117s`

An `ExternalName` service type is one that, instead of defining an internal load-balancer that holds the list of the active target pods, is only a **CNAME** to another service.

Here’s its definition:
`apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    app.dmp/name: app  
  name: app-ext  
  namespace: app  
spec:  
  ports:  
  - name: http-app  
    port: 8080  
    protocol: TCP  
    targetPort: 8080  
  - name: tcp-hazelcast  
    port: 5701  
    protocol: TCP  
    targetPort: 5701  
  externalName: idle.manager.svc.cluster.local  
  sessionAffinity: None  
  type: ExternalName`

This specific definition makes the name `app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local` resolve to `idle.manager.svc.cluster.local` (well, CNAME, then resolve to the IP of the service, `10.0.23.221`)

Let’s look again at our Listeners on the `manager` pod:
`istioctl pc listeners manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --port 5701  
ADDRESS         PORT     TYPE  
10.12.0.12      5701     TCP  
10.0.18.143     5701     TCP  
10.0.23.154     5701     TCP  
0.0.0.0         5701     TCP`

we now have a new `0.0.0.0` entry !   
Let’s look at the config:

        &#34;deprecatedV1&#34;: {

        },  
        &#34;trafficDirection&#34;: &#34;OUTBOUND&#34;  
    }  
]`

Suddenly it’s a little more complicated.

*   first, we accept any destination IP for port **5701**
*   then we enter the **_filterChains_**_
-_ if the real destinations is ourselves (the pod IP, `10.12.0.11`), drop the request (send it to the **B_lackHoleCluster_**)
- else use cluster `outbound|5701||app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local `to find the forwarding address

Let’s check this cluster:
`istioctl pc clusters manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager  --fqdn app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local --port 5701 -o json``[  
    {  
        &#34;name&#34;: &#34;outbound|5701||app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
        &#34;type&#34;: &#34;STRICT_DNS&#34;,  
        &#34;connectTimeout&#34;: &#34;1s&#34;,  
        &#34;loadAssignment&#34;: {  
            &#34;clusterName&#34;: &#34;outbound|5701||app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
            &#34;endpoints&#34;: [  
                {  
                    &#34;locality&#34;: {},  
                    &#34;lbEndpoints&#34;: [  
                        {  
                            &#34;endpoint&#34;: {  
                                &#34;address&#34;: {  
                                    &#34;socketAddress&#34;: {  
                                        &#34;address&#34;: &#34;idle.manager.svc.cluster.local&#34;,  
                                        &#34;portValue&#34;: 5701  
                                    }  
                                }  
                            },`

Once again, this cluster is pretty simple, it just forward the traffic to the server `idle.manager.svc.cluster.local` using the DNS to get the real IP.

Let’s do a telnet again to the second manager’s Pod and check the logs:
`manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx istio-proxy [2020-07-23T14:47:24.040Z] &#34;- - -&#34; 0 UF,URX &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; 0 0 1000 - &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;-&#34; &#34;10.0.23.221:5701&#34; outbound|5701||app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local - 10.12.1.6:5701 10.12.0.12:52852 - -`

1.  request is in error: `0 UF,URX` 
From the [Envoy doc](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/observability/access_log/usage#configuration), UF is _Upstream connection failure_ and URX is [_maximum connect attempts (TCP)_](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/tcp_proxy/v3/tcp_proxy.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-tcp-proxy-v3-tcpproxy-max-connect-attempts) _was reached_.
This is perfectly normal as the `idle` service does not expose the port **5701** (nor the Pod binds it)
2.  request was forwarded to `outbound|5701||app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local `cluster

Wait, **WHAAAAT** ?  
A `service` created in another Namespace just broke our Hazelcast cluster ?

The explanation is easy here… before this service was created, the second Pod’s IP was unknown and Envoy was using the `Passthrough` cluster. Now, the IP is still unknown but is matched by the catchall `0.0.0.0:5710` listener.

The explanation is easy here… before this service was created, the real Pod’s IP was _unknown_ in the mesh and Envoy was using the `Passthrough` cluster to send the request directly to it.   
Now, the IP is still _unknown_ but is matched by the catchall `0.0.0.0:5710 `Listener and forwarded to a known Cluster, `outbound|5701||app-ext.app.svc.cluster.local`, which is pointing to the `idle` Service.

### Solving the issue

What can we do to recover our Hazelcast cluster ?

#### no 5701 port

One of the solutions would be to **NOT** expose the port **5701** in the `ExternalName` service. Then, no `0.0.0.0:5701 `Listener, and traffic will flow through the `Passthrough` Cluster as before. Not ideal to track our Mesh traffic, but working fine.

#### no ExternalName

Another solution would be to not use `ExternalName` at all…

The `Externalname` was in fact a new service that was added in certain circumstances where we want all the calls going to the `app` service to be forwarded to the `idle.manager` service.  
Beside the fact that it broke our Hazelcast cluster, it also means that we had to delete the `ClusterIP` service then re-create it as an `ExternalName` type. Both of these actions forced Istiod (Pilot) to re-build the complete mesh config and update all the proxies in the mesh, including a change in the Listeners that caused a drain of all opened connexions, twice !  
This is one of the worst pattern you can have when using a service mesh.

Instead of playing with `Service` resource, one possible pattern would be to add a `VirtualService`for the `app` application that will send traffic to the `idle.manager`service only when we need. This would not create or delete any listener and will only update the route:
`apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1  
kind: VirtualService  
metadata:  
  name: app-idle  
spec:  
  hosts:  
  - app.app.svc.cluster.local  
  http:  
  - name: to-idle  
    route:  
    - destination:  
        host: idle.manager.svc.cluster.local  
        port:  
          number: 8080`

This is saying that all traffic for Service `app.app.svc.cluster.local` must be send to `idle.manager.svc.cluster.local:8080`.

When we want the traffic to effectively go to the `app` application, just update the `VirtualService` and set the `destination` to `app.app.svc.cluster.local`, or simply delete it.

#### Sidecars

With recent Istio, we can also leverage the use of `Sidecar` resource to limit what the `manager` Pod can see inside the mesh.   
Specifically in this case, we could use an annotation on the `ExternalName` service to only make it visible in the `app` namespace:
`apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    app/name: app  
  annotations:  
    networking.istio.io/exportTo: &#34;.&#34;  
  name: app-ext  
  namespace: app  
spec:  
  ports:  
  - name: http-app  
    port: 8080  
    protocol: TCP  
    targetPort: 8080  
  - name: tcp-hazelcast  
    port: 5701  
    protocol: TCP  
    targetPort: 5701  
  externalName: idle.manager.svc.cluster.local  
  sessionAffinity: None  
  type: ExternalName`

By adding the annotation `networking.istio.io/exportTo: “.”` the service is not seen by the managers Pods. No more `0.0.0.0:5701`:
`istioctl pc listeners manager-7948dffbdd-p44xx.manager --port 5701``ADDRESS         PORT     TYPE  
10.0.18.143     5701     TCP  
10.12.0.12      5701     TCP  
10.0.25.229     5701     TCP`

#### different TCP ports

If we’re willing to update our application, there’s a few other solutions we could use as well.

We could use different ports for different TCP services. This is the hardest to put in place when you’re already dealing with complex applications like databases, but it’s been the only option available in Istio for a long time.

We could also update our applications to use TLS and populate the Server Name Indication (SNI). Envoy/Istio can use SNI to route traffic for TCP services on the same port because Istio treats the SNI for routing TLS/TCP traffic just like it treats the Host header for HTTP traffic.

### Conclusion

First I want to note that no _Hazelcast_ cluster were damaged during this demo :)

The problem here is not linked to Hazelcast at all and can happen with any set of services using the same TCP ports.

Istio and Envoy have very limited way to play with TCP or unknown protocols. When the only thing you have to inspect is the IP and the port, there’s not much to do.

Always keep in mind the best practices to configure your clusters:

*   try to avoid using the same port number for different TCP services where you can
*   always prefix the protocol inside port names (`tcp-hazelcast`, `http-frontend`, `grpc-backend`) — see [protocol selection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/protocol-selection/) docs
*   add `Sidecar` resources as early as possible to restrict the sprawl of configuration, and set the default `exportTo` to namespace local in your Istio installation
*   configure your applications to communicate by names (FQDN), not IPs
*   always configure FQDN (including `svc.cluster.local`) in Istio Resources
